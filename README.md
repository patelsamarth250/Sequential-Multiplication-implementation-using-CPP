# Sequential-Multiplication-implementation-using-CPP
Implemented Sequential Multiplication of Unsigned numbers (decimal or binary ) using C++ Programming Language.
This will show you the complete process of how sequential multiplication works defining each iterations.

Maily it is the process of Binary Addition and Right shifting. So you can refer the functions I created,
1. string addition(string A, string B) : for addition of 2 binary numbers
2. string rshift(string A, string B)   : for right shifting bits of two binary numbers

And I created function, string dec_to_bin(int dec) : to convert decimal number into binary if user wanted to give input in decimal form.
